As a part of HARLEM - Human Recognition Action Recognition project. This is an automated zooming system using YOLOv5 for real-time video, which detects and tracks specified objects to adjust the view dynamically. Key features include Region of Interest (RoI) Centralization to keep objects centered, adaptive zoom based on object size and position, and smooth transitions to avoid abrupt changes.
